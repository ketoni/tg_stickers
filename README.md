### Scripts for Telegram stickers

Some old tools for Telegram Messenger sticker creation and conversion.  
The ```stickerize.scm``` script can be used with GIMP, which autocrops and resizes the image, and adds a sticker'ish look.  
In ```converter/``` a (Windows) batch-script can be used to convert any PNG-images to ```.webp``` -format, which is the image format of Telegram stickers.
